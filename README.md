- #### Data Structures & Operations
    - Singly Linked List
        - Add (at the beginning, at the end, at specific position)
        - Remove (at the beginning, at the end, at specific position)
        - Iterate
        - Length
    - Doubly Linked List
        - Add (at the end)
        - Iterate (forward, backward)
    - One-Dimensional Array
        - Iterate
        - Swap items
